# Sequences

## Container and Flat sequences
A container sequence holds references to the objects it contains, which may be of any type,
while a flat sequence store the value of its contents in its own memory space, not as
distinct Python objects.

## Mutable and Immutable sequences

# Genexps (Generator Expressions)
Genexp saves memory because it yields items one by one using the iterator protocol instead
of building a whole list just to feed another constructor.

Genexps use the same syntax as listcomps, but are enclosed in parenteses rather than
brackets.
